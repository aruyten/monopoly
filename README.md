# monopoly-dist

intentions:<br>
the goal of this program is to calculate the liklihood of landing on certain spaces in monopoly.  It factors in scenarios such as landing on the "go directly to jail" space, and rolling 3 doubles in a row. 

operation:<br>
users specify the number of moves that will be made and the program will output the percentage chance of landing on each space 

future plans:<br>
adding the outcomes of community chest and chance cards to better simulate the game


NOTE: this program is still very much a work in progress
